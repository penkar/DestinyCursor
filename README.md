# DestinyCursor
Destiny UI Style cursor

Very basic implementation that really would not work on an existing UI unless you performed a heavy redesign on all links, buttons, clickable items etc. etc.

Implemented in React, made possible by SASS. If you have played Bungie's Destiny you will remember the white circular cursor that you use in the user / inventory screens. I wanted to make something similar for a web browser instead of the traditional arrow. 

This current version uses the white spinning circles, and will change color to green and red depending on what you are currently hovered over. Rotating circle will go the opposite direction when hovering. Definetly not practical unless you are willing to go all in. Which I am not, so it stops here... Probably...
