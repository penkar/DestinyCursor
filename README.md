Destiny UI Style cursor

### Installation

- None, just open the index.html file in your browser.
- In retrospect you really don't need React... or SASS or any of that. Just the CSS and HTML would have been enough, and anything else would have been overkill. I've removed all the extras and left the basic CSS and HTML in the `index.html` file and accompany assets folder.
- I'm just letting this repo sit here as a reminder to myself to not over-engineer things.
